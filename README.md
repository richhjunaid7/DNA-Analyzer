# DNA Analyzer ðŸ§¬

This is a small Python project I made to practice programming and learn about DNA sequence analysis.  
The program takes a DNA sequence as input, checks if itâ€™s valid (only A, T, G, C allowed), and then gives a report:

- Counts of each base (A, T, G, C)  
- Total AT and GC pairs  
- AT% and GC% content  
- Melting temperature (calculated using Wallace rule)

## How to run
1. Clone this repo or download the code.  
2. Run the script with Python 3:  
   ```bash
   python dna_analyzer.py
Base Composition Report:-
Adenine: 3
Thymine: 4
Guanine: 2
Cytosine: 1
Total AT present in the sequence: 7
Total GC present in the sequence: 3

Content Report:-
GC content of a sequence is: 30.00%
AT content of a sequence is: 70.00%
Melting Temperature (Tm): 24Â°C

Why I built this?
I wanted to combine my Python practice with my biotechnology background. Itâ€™s a simple project, but it helped me understand both coding and basic sequence analysis better.
